# Tillers Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
Code quality is non-negotiable. All code MUST pass linting, formatting, and static analysis checks before commit. Every pull request MUST maintain or improve code quality metrics. Technical debt MUST be documented and addressed within two development cycles.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and ensures long-term project sustainability.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. The TDD cycle is strictly enforced: Red (write failing test) → Green (make test pass) → Refactor (improve code quality). No implementation code SHALL be merged without corresponding tests that verify the requirements.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are met, catches regressions early, and provides living documentation of system behavior.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces MUST follow established design patterns and accessibility standards. User interactions MUST be predictable and consistent across the application. Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly. Loading states and feedback MUST be provided for all user actions.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user satisfaction, and ensures accessibility for all users.

### IV. Performance Standards
All features MUST meet defined performance benchmarks before release. Response times MUST be under 200ms for critical user actions. Memory usage MUST remain within specified limits. Performance regressions MUST be caught and addressed before deployment.

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user experience and system scalability.

### V. Observability and Monitoring
All critical paths MUST include comprehensive logging and monitoring. Error conditions MUST be logged with sufficient context for debugging. Performance metrics MUST be collected and tracked. System health MUST be observable through dashboards and alerts.

**Rationale**: Observability enables rapid issue detection, debugging, and continuous improvement.

## Quality Gates

### Code Review Requirements
- All code changes MUST pass automated quality checks (linting, formatting, static analysis)
- All code changes MUST have accompanying tests with adequate coverage
- All code changes MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Performance impact MUST be assessed for changes affecting critical paths

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage MUST be ≥90% for new code
- Integration tests MUST cover all API endpoints and user workflows
- Performance tests MUST validate response time requirements
- Accessibility tests MUST verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Performance Requirements
- Critical user actions MUST complete within 200ms (95th percentile)
- Initial page load MUST complete within 3 seconds
- Memory usage MUST not exceed 100MB per user session
- Database queries MUST complete within 50ms (95th percentile)

## Development Standards

### Code Organization
- Follow established directory structure and naming conventions
- Separate concerns: business logic, data access, and presentation layers
- Use dependency injection for testability and maintainability
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs

### Security Standards
- All user inputs MUST be validated and sanitized
- Authentication and authorization MUST be implemented for all protected resources
- Sensitive data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed within 24 hours of discovery

### Documentation Standards
- All public APIs MUST be documented with examples
- Complex business logic MUST include inline documentation
- README files MUST be maintained and accurate
- Architecture decisions MUST be recorded and accessible

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution amendments require documentation of the change rationale, impact assessment on existing code, and approval from project maintainers. All amendments MUST include a migration plan for existing code that conflicts with new principles.

### Compliance Review
All pull requests MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles. Violations MUST be justified in writing with specific rationale for why adherence is not possible. Complexity that violates principles MUST be refactored unless critical business requirements prevent it.

### Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for ensuring constitutional compliance. Automated checks MUST enforce quality gates where possible. Regular audits MUST review adherence to principles and identify areas for improvement.

Use `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for implementation planning that aligns with these constitutional principles.
