# Feature Specification: TilleRS - Keyboard-First Tiling Window Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application called TilleRs, TilleRS is a keyboard-first tiling window manager that transforms how macOS users work by automatically organizing windows into logical workspaces, eliminating the constant manual dragging and resizing that breaks focus. Built for developers, designers, and power users who value efficiency, it enables instant context switching between projects while maintaining predictable window layouts across multiple monitors. By removing the friction of window management, TilleRS helps users stay in flow state and reclaim hours of productivity lost to repetitive mouse interactions."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A power user (developer, designer, or knowledge worker) launches TilleRS and sets up logical workspaces for different projects. When working on "Project A", they use keyboard shortcuts to instantly arrange all related windows (code editor, browser, terminal, documentation) into a predictable tiled layout across their monitors. When they need to switch to "Project B", a single keyboard command transitions them to a completely different workspace with its own window arrangement, eliminating the need to manually find, resize, and position windows.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has multiple applications open and TilleRS running, **When** they press the workspace switch shortcut, **Then** all windows automatically arrange into the predefined tiling layout for that workspace
2. **Given** a user is working in a tiled workspace, **When** they open a new application window, **Then** the window automatically positions itself according to the workspace's tiling rules without manual positioning
3. **Given** a user has configured multiple monitors, **When** they switch workspaces, **Then** window layouts are maintained consistently across all monitors according to the workspace configuration
4. **Given** a user wants to create a new workspace, **When** they use the keyboard shortcut for workspace creation, **Then** they can define a new logical workspace with custom tiling patterns and assign it to specific applications
5. **Given** a user is in flow state working on a task, **When** they need to switch between related windows, **Then** they can navigate using only keyboard shortcuts without reaching for the mouse

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a required application for a workspace is not currently running?
- How does the system handle applications that don't support standard window management?
- What happens when a user connects or disconnects a monitor while workspaces are active?
- How does the system behave when a workspace contains more windows than can fit in the defined tiling pattern?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide keyboard-only window management without requiring mouse interactions
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically organize windows into logical workspaces based on user-defined configurations
- **FR-003**: System MUST support instant context switching between different project workspaces using keyboard shortcuts
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain predictable window layouts across multiple monitors
- **FR-005**: System MUST eliminate the need for manual window dragging and resizing during normal workflow
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve workspace configurations between application sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically arrange newly opened windows according to active workspace tiling rules
- **FR-008**: System MUST support customizable tiling patterns for different types of work (development, design, general productivity)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide workspace creation and configuration capabilities through keyboard interface
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle multi-monitor setups with consistent workspace behavior across displays
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with macOS window management without conflicting with existing system shortcuts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific macOS compatibility requirements and system permission needs]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum number of workspaces per user]
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle workspace switching with response time of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance target - sub-second? specific millisecond requirement?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workspace**: A logical grouping of applications and windows with defined tiling layout rules, assigned keyboard shortcuts, and multi-monitor positioning preferences
- **Tiling Pattern**: A predefined arrangement template that specifies how windows should be positioned and sized within a workspace
- **Window Rule**: Configuration that defines how specific applications or window types should behave within a workspace
- **Monitor Configuration**: Settings that define how workspaces should utilize multiple displays and maintain consistency across monitor setups
- **Keyboard Mapping**: User-defined shortcuts for workspace operations, window navigation, and tiling pattern adjustments
